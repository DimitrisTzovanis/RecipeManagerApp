# Android Recipe Application

## Members: Dimitris Tzovanis, Elpida Stasinou


This is an application that runs on Android devices and provides an interface for the system. Through this the user:
- can choose their ingredients from a list and the app will show possible recipes that require such ingredients
- can add their own recipes (ingredients and execution)
- admins can add new ingredients to the list of available ones
